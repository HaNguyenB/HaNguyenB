### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi my name is Ha Nguyen (she/her).
I'm a rising junior from [Oberlin College](https://www.oberlin.edu/). 
Double major in Computer Science and East Asian Studies.
I'm looking for software engineering opportunities for Summer 2024.
I have experiences working as a game developer intern at [BonBonGame](https://apps.apple.com/kn/developer/bonbongame-com/id1219863203) in Summer 2022.
I'm spending this summer at [National Central University](https://www.ncu.edu.tw/en/index.html) in Taiwan studying Mandarin.
I'm currently learning React Native for mobile app development.
In my spare time I enjoy watching and learning how to make films.
